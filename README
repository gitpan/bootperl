Bootable perl

See perl/README for details about perl compatibility.
It's based upon the latest sine sources I could locate, but using the old
boot-trad bootloader from the latest xos sources I could locate.

Remember to DISCONNECT ALL PARALLEL PORT device before using this kernel on a
system.  For debugging with bochs all console and debug output is written
to the virtual parallel port.  This is unlikely to be good on a real system.

To compile:

make init
make

To use run bochs in this directory, qemu using boot/image as the fda image,
or write boot/image to a floppy.
